To configure the variables for the bot, you will need to create a file named '.env' within the project directory and define the variables within. 
Here is an example of the expected format for the contents of the '.env' file:

DISCORD_TOKEN=your-token-here

Make sure to replace 'your-token-here' with the actual token for your Discord bot.
